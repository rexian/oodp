# Composite Design Pattern

Composite design pattern is used when we treat a group of objects in similar way as a single object. Composite pattern composes objects as a tree structure to represent part and whole hierarchy. This type of design pattern comes under structural pattern as this pattern creates a tree structure of group of objects.

The pattern creates a class that contains group of its own objects, and provides ways to modify its group of same objects.
